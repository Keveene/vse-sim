These are some methods for running VSE (Voter Satisfaction Efficiency)
simulations for various voting systems. 

Requirements: python3, scipy, pydoc

Testing uses pydoc, which should make most things pretty self-documenting.

E.g.:

    python3 vse.py -v

# Running simulations

Try

    $ python3
    >>> csvs = CsvBatch(PolyaModel(), [[Score(), baseRuns], [Mav(), medianRuns]], nvot=5, ncand=4, niter=3)
    >>> csvs.saveFile()

and look for the results in `SimResults1.csv`
